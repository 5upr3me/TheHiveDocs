# Manage dashboards

In TheHive 4, dashboards have an owner and can be shared to an organisation. As the notion of global dashboards, visible to everybody, doesn't exist anymore, the default dashboards can't be created  automatically, like in TheHive 3.

The dashboards from TheHive 3 stay compatible and can be exported and imported to TheHive 4. The default dashboard from TheHive 3 can be downloaded from GitHub repository: https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/tree/3.4.2/migration/12/dashboards
