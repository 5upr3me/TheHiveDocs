A default system group name "*admin*" belong to the application and is dedicated to user accounts in charge of administrating the solution. This group contains one default accont named "*admin@thehive.local*" with the password `thehive1234`.

This default group cannot create and own *Cases* of any other related objects like *Tasks* or *Observables*.
